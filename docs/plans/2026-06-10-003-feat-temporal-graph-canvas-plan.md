# feat: Temporal graph canvas — Phase 1 (change signals), Phase 2+ (scrubber, causality)

## Overview

Phase 0 (`2026-06-10-002`, merged) made lab markers **storable over time** and shipped two *text/card* surfaces under `/decisions` (a "what changed since last test" card + per-marker sparklines). It did **not** touch the node-link **graph canvas** (`src/components/graph/`), which still renders all of history at once with no temporal cue. The original brief's thesis — *"the graph should show what changed, when, and what moved around it"* — is therefore unmet **in the graph itself**.

This plan makes the **canvas** temporal, smallest-useful-thing first:

- **Phase 1 (ships):** biomarker concept nodes whose latest reading moved carry a flag-gated **change decoration** — a Δ direction badge + a **one-shot pulse** on data-change, reduced-motion → static ring — and tapping the node opens the existing detail sheet with **before → after** and a link to the trajectory. Reuses Phase 0's `diffLatestPanels`/`classifyChange` end-to-end. This is the cheapest path to the canvas *visibly* expressing time.
- **Phase 2 (deferred, validation-gated):** the **time scrubber** (`asOf`) — drag a date axis; nodes dim/hide by when their evidence landed; the graph re-decorates as-of that date; event overlays for uploads/visits/actions.
- **Phase 3 (deferred):** **causality over time** — populate the latent `OUTCOME_CHANGED` / `intervention_event` edges (defined in the schema, never written) so the graph shows "you started X → marker Y moved."

Phase 1 is the recommended stopping point until a real demo/dogfood session validates the feel — same sequencing discipline as `2026-06-08-001` (physics motion: Phase 1 ships, Phase 2 gated).

## Problem Frame

The canvas (`graph-canvas.tsx` + `use-graph-state.ts`) runs a deterministic D3 force sim with a shipped settle-in entrance, spring drag, and zoom — but **zero temporal signal**. The only time-awareness anywhere is a +1 importance bonus for recently-cited nodes (`importance.ts`). Phase 0 added the *data* (dated `observation` instances, `diffLatestPanels`) but routed every temporal *view* to `/decisions`. So a user looking at their health **graph** cannot see that ferritin just moved, or what changed since their last panel. Closing that — on the canvas — is this plan.

## Requirements Trace

Phase-tagged so a stop at the Phase 1 boundary is honest about what's delivered.

- **R1** *(P1)* — A biomarker concept node whose latest reading changed vs the prior panel renders a **direction badge** (range-relative: improved / worsened / stable / new — reusing `classifyChange`'s vocabulary, never causal/alarming).
- **R2** *(P1)* — On load (and on in-session data change), changed nodes play a **one-shot pulse** that **does not perturb the converged layout** (determinism contract from `2026-06-08-001` holds); motion ends at a frozen rest (no perpetual ticking).
- **R3** *(P1)* — `prefers-reduced-motion` / SSR / node-test render the **static end-state** (badge + a static ring, no pulse) — exactly today's no-motion behavior plus the badge.
- **R4** *(P1)* — Tapping a changed node opens `node-detail-sheet` showing **before → after** (value, unit, dates) + a link to `/decisions/marker/[name]`.
- **R5** *(P1)* — All of the above is gated by `LONGITUDINAL_GRAPH_ENABLED`. **Flag off → `/api/record` payload and canvas render are byte-for-byte today's** (verified by a parity test). Instance *writes* remain unconditional (Phase 0 decision).
- **R6** *(P2, gated)* — A time scrubber sets an `asOf` date; nodes whose earliest evidence postdates `asOf` dim/hide; surviving nodes show their value as-of that date; scrub transitions are eased and reduced-motion-safe.
- **R7** *(P3, gated)* — `intervention_event` + `OUTCOME_CHANGED` edges are written from the action lifecycle so "what moved after action X" is graph-native; event overlays mark uploads/visits/actions.

## Scope Boundaries

- ❌ No continuous scrubber in Phase 1 (R6 is deferred).
- ❌ No causality-edge population in Phase 1/2 (R7 deferred — it's data-plumbing, not visualization).
- ❌ No new node/edge **types**; no schema change in Phase 1 (the change signal is a computed decoration on the wire payload, not persisted).
- ❌ No mobile force-graph motion — mobile renders `GraphListView`; canvas motion stays desktop-only via the existing gate. (Phase 1 should still surface the badge in the list view as static text — cheap, and mobile shouldn't be temporally blind.)
- ❌ No change to the 200-node cap, the `/api/record` contract shape (only an **optional additive** field), or the deterministic first-paint layout.
- ❌ No persistence of view state (asOf, toggles) to the DB.

### Deferred to Separate Tasks

- Phase 2 (scrubber) and Phase 3 (causality) — own plans, gated on Phase 1 shipping + a validation trigger (a demo/dogfood session shows the change signal lands but users want to move through time).
- Feeding the history series into the scribe/LLM context — DPIA/consent-gated (brainstorm §9); unrelated to the canvas and out of scope here.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **The change signal is a computed decoration on `/api/record`, not a new persisted field.** The record route computes `diffLatestPanels` (flag-gated, already in a try/degrade pattern from Phase 0) and passes a `joinKey → change` map into `aggregateRecord`, which attaches an **optional** `change?: { direction, classification, beforeValue, afterValue, unit, beforeAt, afterAt }` to matching **biomarker concept** nodes in `nodeRecordToWire`. One round-trip; flag-off omits it entirely (R5).
- **Marker→node join reuses Phase 0's key.** `diffLatestPanels` keys by `registryKey ?? canonicalKey`; biomarker concept nodes carry `canonicalKey` + `attributes.registryKey`. Match on that — no displayName matching (the collision Phase 0's review fixed).
- **Pulse is a pure primitive + the existing `animate()` driver.** Add `pulseScale(easedAlpha) -> number` to `src/lib/graph/motion.ts` (pure, node-testable, like `entranceFrame`). The hook drives it via the same `framer-motion animate(0,1,{duration,ease})` already used for the entrance, on a **transform-scale on the node's own `<g>`** — never on `cx/cy`, so converged positions are untouched (R2 determinism). One-shot; torn down in the same cleanup as the entrance/drag handles (R2 no-perpetual-tick).
- **Reduced-motion / SSR / node-test → badge + static ring, no pulse** (R3) — reuse `computeMotionAllowed()`; the static ring reuses the existing selection-halo render path with a change-hued stroke.
- **Badge colors are data-driven SVG classes → they MUST be safelisted.** `tailwind.config.ts` already has a `safelist`; add the change-hue fill/stroke classes (the documented JIT trap: `tailwind-content-glob-missing-classes-2026-05-16`). Caught by visual audit, not build-green.
- **Optional importance lift (decide at impl):** a changed marker is worth surfacing — consider a small `+1` importance bonus (mirroring the recency bonus in `importance.ts`) so a moved marker isn't hidden below the 200-node cap. Gated by the same flag. Flag this in the unit; default to including it only if the visual audit shows changed markers getting capped out.
- **Test strategy is fixed by the env:** vitest is `node` (no DOM/rAF). The unit-tested surface is the pure pieces — `pulseScale`, the diff→node decoration mapper, the classification→hue map, the flag-off parity of the payload. The gesture/pulse feel is the **visual-audit gate** (mandatory for canvas motion per `visual-audit-non-optional-ui-gate-2026-05-16`).

## Implementation Units (Phase 1)

- [x] **U1: Change decoration on the record payload.** Optional `change?` on `GraphNodeWire`; the record route computes `diffLatestPanels` flag-gated and attaches it to matching biomarker wire nodes via `applyChangesToWireNodes` **after** `aggregateRecord` (aggregate/`nodeRecordToWire` left untouched — lower-risk than threading through the pure aggregator). `markerJoinKey` is the single-sourced registryKey/canonicalKey join (panel-diff refactored to use it; `MarkerChange.joinKey` exposed). Tests: marker-key, node-change-map, record-route flag on/off/degrade/single-panel. ✅
- [x] **U2: Pure pulse primitive + classification hue.** `pulseScale(easedAlpha)` in `motion.ts`; `changeVisual(classification)` in `visual-encoding.ts` (improved=positive / worsened=alert / new=accent / else neutral; design-system tokens, not raw palette). Tests: bounds + peak + clamp; tone map total over a string. ✅
- [x] **U3 (static): Render the change signal on the canvas.** `use-graph-state.ts` appends a static tone **ring** + a small direction **badge** (↑/↓/→/+) to decorated biomarker node groups; `dataSignature` includes `change.classification` so it re-renders on decoration change; tone classes safelisted in `tailwind.config.ts`. ✅
- [ ] **U3 (motion): one-shot pulse — DEFERRED, visual-audit-gated.** Drive `pulseScale` via a self-contained `animate()` on a dedicated pulse ring (opacity/radius, never x/y), torn down with the existing handles; reduced-motion → the static ring already shipped. **Split out because it can't be browser-verified in this environment, and adding a second `animate()` loop to `use-graph-state.ts` unverified is the kind of motion change the repo's visual-audit-non-optional rule exists for.** `pulseScale` is implemented + tested, ready for it.
- [x] **U4: Detail sheet before→after + list-view chip.** `node-detail-sheet.tsx` "Since your last test" section (before → after, range-relative label, dates, trajectory link, non-advice disclaimer); `graph-list-view.tsx` static change chip (mobile parity). ✅
- [ ] **U5: Flag-flip readiness + audit.** Flag-off parity test ✅. **Remaining (browser-gated, cannot run here):** visual audit of the badge/ring/chip + detail section (dense/sparse, 320px legibility, converged-layout-unchanged), Tailwind cold-render check, then the U3-motion pulse. Flag stays off until done.

## Phase 2+ (sketch only — separate plans, gated)

- **Scrubber (R6):** `asOf` dimension on the read path (per-node first-evidence date + as-of value from the trajectory); eased scrub transitions in `use-graph-state.ts`; event overlays from `SourceDocument.capturedAt` / `Action.*At`. Validation trigger: Phase 1 lands and a session shows demand to move through time.
- **Causality (R7):** write `intervention_event` + `OUTCOME_CHANGED` from the action lifecycle (the loop Phase B already tracks); "what moved after I started X."

## System-Wide Impact

- **Read path:** `/api/record` gains one optional field + (flag-on) one `diffLatestPanels` call already bounded in Phase 0. Flag-off path unchanged.
- **Determinism/motion:** seed + 80-tick solve + converged layout unchanged; pulse is scale-only on the node group, torn down with the existing handles; reduced-motion/SSR/node-test = static. The `2026-06-08-001` contracts (R4 determinism, R6 transient) are explicit requirements here.
- **Unchanged invariants:** node cap, mobile list view, edge rendering, instance exclusion from the canvas (Phase 0 U6), GDPR (no new persisted data in Phase 1).

## Risks & Dependencies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Pulse perturbs converged positions → fixture/SSR drift | Scale-only on the node `<g>`, never `cx/cy`; characterization test that converged positions are byte-identical (R2) |
| Perpetual ticking / battery drain | One-shot `animate()`, torn down in the existing cleanup; reduced-motion gets none (R3/R6) |
| Data-driven badge hues dropped by Tailwind JIT | Safelist the classes; cold-render check in the audit (documented trap) |
| Changed marker hidden below the 200-node cap | Optional flag-gated importance lift (U1/impl decision), validated in the audit |
| Flag-off behaviour drifts | Byte-for-byte payload parity test (R5) |
| Over-investment before validation | Phase 1 only; scrubber + causality gated on a real trigger |

## Sequencing & Opportunity Cost

This is a pre-launch, flag-gated, zero-real-user surface. **Phase 1 (Units 1–5) is the minimum that makes the graph visibly temporal and reuses already-merged Phase 0 data — and is the recommended stop.** Phase 2 (scrubber) is the headline but materially larger and weakly justified until someone sees Phase 1 and asks to move through time; Phase 3 (causality) is data-plumbing that should follow the action-lifecycle work, not lead it. Building either now would be speculative motion work on a graph no user has yet asked to time-travel.
