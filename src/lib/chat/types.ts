/**
 * Chat turn runtime contract (U3).
 *
 * `runChatTurn` is an async generator that drives one user → assistant
 * exchange end-to-end: it persists the user message, routes the
 * utterance, runs the scribe, and persists the assistant message. The
 * caller (U4 SSE route, or a test) consumes the yielded events in order
 * and has no other view into the internal state.
 *
 * Event ordering is load-bearing:
 *   routed → token* → done    — success
 *   routed → token* → error   — mid-stream failure
 *   error                     — pre-routing failure (e.g. router throws)
 * `done` and `error` are mutually exclusive and terminal.
